What you need to know when building software for UNEP-Live
==============

Main themes:
- Code sharing and version control
- Testing
- Documentation
- Deployment
- Code monitoring and review
- Technology choices

## Code sharing and version control
Principle:  All code is open, public and easily available for anyone to contribute and share.

1. All UNEP-live code is commited to github in a public repository
2. We'll use the shared repository model for updating the code:  [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#shared-repository-model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#shared-repository-model)

## Documentation
Principle:  All code is documented to a level which would allow a fresh developer with knowledge of the used programming language to be able to contribute to the code and deploy it to production with minimal involvement from the development team.

1. Use a README file to explain the developer set-up 
2. Use the Wiki for deployment instructions.
